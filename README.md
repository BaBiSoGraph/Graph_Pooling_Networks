# Graph_Pooling_Networks

Graph Pooling implementation from [doi](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/17/10/P10004) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05952). \
`algorithm.py` containts the implementation, and `layer.py` adds a wrapper for the use as a Keras layer for Neural Networks, as depicted in the paper.\
If you have interest in the analysis and the used data, please contact us, we are much obliged to provide the information.
